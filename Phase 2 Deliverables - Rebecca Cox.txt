Rebecca CoxProject 2 DeliverablesAccessibility concerns:Persona 1: Brianna: red/green colorblindnessOur color palette is green, which could cause confusion if we use the colors to signify anything clickable (external links if we have any, etc). Underlining links would help solve this issue.  Alt text is also necessary. May want to include a white/black in our color palette so text is easily read.Persona 2: Jimmy: younger ageOnly accessibility concern I have for Jimmy is that he knows how basic websites work, however he may not understand how certain things work without instruction. Images that are clickable need to show that they are clickable.Lovely Poison FrogThe Lovely Poison frog is the smallest species in the Phyllobates genus. It only reaches two and a half (2.5) centimeters in length. They are primarily located in North America/Central America. They tend to be black with pale yellow to gold to orange stripes running down the body. The black is so deep they almost seem entirely black.
