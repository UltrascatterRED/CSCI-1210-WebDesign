# Accessibility Considerations for the Website

This document outlines specific usability concerns for our personas and the resolutions to address those concerns, ensuring our website is accessible and user-friendly for all audiences.

## Persona Accessibility

### Persona 1 - Fiona Minaga

**Usability Concern:** Fiona, being detail-oriented and a nature-lover, requires in-depth information that is also accessible. She might have students or blog followers with various accessibility needs.

**Resolution:** 
- Use clear, descriptive headings and subheadings to structure content for easy navigation via screen readers.
- Ensure all images and diagrams have alt text descriptions for visually impaired users.
- Implement high-contrast text and background color combinations to accommodate users with visual impairments.

### Persona 2 - Peter Johnson

**Usability Concern:** Peter is tech-savvy but looks for content that his child, who is 9 years old, can understand and interact with safely. The website should be navigable and understandable for both adults and children.

**Resolution:** 
- Incorporate straightforward, jargon-free language suitable for a younger audience.
- Design the interface with larger, clickable elements to make navigation easier for children.
- Include parental control features that allow adults to manage the content accessible to children.
