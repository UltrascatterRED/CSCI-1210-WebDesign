        <b>African Dwarf</b> Frogs are native to the continent of Africa, near
        the equator and mainly in forests. These frogs spend their lives
        underwater, but must frequently come to the surface for air, since they
        have lungs instead of gills! Their skin is usually a brownish green,
        sometimes with black spots, and they prefer to stay near the bottom of
        the bodies of water they inhabit, where their colors help them blend in.
        They are also popular as pets, since they do not require very much care
        to thrive.
