            <p>
                African Dwarf Frogs are native to the continent of Africa, near the equator and
                mainly in forests. These frogs spend their lives underwater, but must frequently
                come to the surface for air, since they have lungs instead of gills! Their skin
                is usually a brownish green, sometimes with black spots, and they prefer to stay
                near the bottom of the bodies of water they inhabit, where their colors help them
                blend in. They are also popular as pets, since they do not require very much care
                to thrive.
