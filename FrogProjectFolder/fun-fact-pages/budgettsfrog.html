        <b>Budgett's Frogs</b> are native to South America. They are
        intelligent and often kept as pets because of their appearance. They
        have also been called Freddy Krueger frogs for their long fingers and
        aggressive nature. These frogs can grow up to five inches in size. They
        are nocturnal and sometimes show cannibalistic behavior. When threatened
        by a predator, the Budgett's frog will raise up on its legs and try to
        look as large as possible. It may also lunge for the perceived threat,
        make noises and bite.
