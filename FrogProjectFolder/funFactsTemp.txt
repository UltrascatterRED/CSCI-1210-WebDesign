AFRICAN DWARF FROG

African dwarf frogs are native to the continent of Africa, near the equator and
mainly in forests. These frogs spend their lives underwater, but must frequently
come to the surface for air, since they have lungs instead of gills! Their skin
is usually a brownish green, sometimes with black spots, and they prefer to stay
near the bottom of the bodies of water they inhabit, where their colors help them
blend in. They are also popular as pets, since they do not require very much care
to thrive.

PUMPKIN TOADLET

Pumpkin Toadlets are small, bright orange frogs native to the rainforests of 
Southeastern Brazil. Brightly colored frogs like this one are typically
toxic to the touch, and this one is no exception, secreting several potent
toxins! These frogs are incredibly small (about the size of a Skittle!), 
which makes it difficult for them to jump as gracefully as other frogs;
they often end up tumbling through the air and landing on their backs or
bellies!
